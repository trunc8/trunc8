Welcome! I am Siddharth Saha. Please call me *Saha*. 

I am currently at the mecca of robotics --- [CMU Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). I will be conferred the [MRSD](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/) (M.S. in Robotic Systems Development) degree in 2024. My capstone project is *Quadruped Robot for Assistive Search in Narrow and Cluttered Environment* with [Prof. Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/), [AirLab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/air-lab/).


I graduated from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2021, attaining a Bachelor's (with Honors) in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/) and a Minor degree in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of wonderful mentors. I worked with [Prof. Leena Vachhani](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~leena/) on my Undergraduate Thesis and [Prof. Prasanna Gandhi](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/~gandhi/) on another research project related to modeling ultra-flexible inverted pendulum

At the institute, I was the founding member of a fully-funded technical team building a quadruped robot and motivated to solve the international urban search and rescue challenge [RoboCup Rescue League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/10)

My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization and planning for legged robots. You can read the research questions that I find very fascinating [here](https://trunc8.github.io).
