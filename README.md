Welcome! I am Siddharth Saha. My friends call me *Saha*. 

I am currently living my dream — studying at the mecca of robotics, [The Robotics Institute @ CMU](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), and working on quadrupeds. I am in the [M.S. Robotic Systems Development](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/) program, Batch of 2024. My program's cornerstone is the 1.5-year-long capstone project, which I am fortunate to have with [Prof. Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/), [AirLab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/air-lab/). I am using the Unitree quadruped robot for search and rescue in narrow and cluttered environments. Through my life’s work, I want to advance robotic capabilities in unstructured environments with three focuses: motion planning, legged locomotion, and optimization.


I graduated from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2021, attaining a Bachelor's (with Honors) in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/) and a Minor degree in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of wonderful mentors. I worked with [Prof. Leena Vachhani](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~leena/) on my Undergraduate Thesis and [Prof. Prasanna Gandhi](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/~gandhi/) on another research project related to modeling ultra-flexible inverted pendulum

At the institute, I was the founding member of a fully-funded technical team building a quadruped robot and motivated to solve the international urban search and rescue challenge [RoboCup Rescue League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/10)

My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization and planning for legged robots. You can read the research questions that I find very fascinating [here](https://trunc8.github.io).

What distinguishes me, however, is my resilience, curiosity, and hacker mindset.

*Resilience*: Despite my humble family background, I was dead set on a career in robotics during college. I worked for a year after graduation in finance to fund my M.S. tuition. I simultaneously pursued robotics research and completed my Google Summer of Code at JdeRobot.

*Curiosity*: As a hobby, I figure out the mechanisms and technologies behind everyday devices.

*Hacker mindset*: For creating reports, I prefer TeXstudio over OverLeaf because of speed. But its symbols packages clashed with the powerline symbols on my [Linux rice](https://trunc8.github.io/2021/03/10/first-linux-rice). So I put my TeXstudio inside a Docker environment and faced no problem ever again! I have [blogged](https://trunc8.github.io/2021/05/22/tut-texstudio-docker) about the steps to achieve this.

I leverage all these traits to solve problems. What matters the most to me is the quality of the problem; other factors are of less importance. I feel most passionate of all about optimization and planning for legged robots.

My software engineering experience ranges from short-life codes, which won me national and international robotics competitions, to long-life codes, contributing to the mammoth code base at Goldman Sachs and also doing open source at JdeRobot.

Besides my love for coding and robotics, I enjoy admiring talent across arts and music — to be inspired by people more gifted than me. Watching Matt McGuire at the drums never fails to electrify me, and listening to Coldplay fills me with joy.
